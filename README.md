# pyeth-pw-recovery


 It follows a similar format as pyethrecover (the presale tool) and uses pyethereum to decode the keystore file.

You need to download/install the pyethereum library: https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum 
See documentation there for requirements and how to.

From pyethereum we need keys.py which has the function decode_keystore_json
